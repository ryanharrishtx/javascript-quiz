# Javascript Quiz
This is a javascript quiz built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. When you click Start Quiz, you are presented with a question that has 3-4 possible answers. By clicking on an answer button, it stores the value and, if correct, adds a point to your total score that is displayed after you either finish the quiz, or run out of time. Starting at 10 seconds, the timer turns red to alert the user that they are almost out of time! Below are the User Story and Acceptance Criteria:
